# Project: Airline Reservation System (Console)

This is a simple console-based airline reservation system implemented in Python.

## Project Overview

*   **Purpose:** This was a first solo project created to learn fundamental programming concepts such as input/output, conditional statements, and basic data handling. The project simulates a simple airline reservation system.
*   **Target Audience:** This is a personal project intended to demonstrate and practice core programming concepts.

## Technologies Used

*   **Programming Language:** Python

## Project Description

*   **Console Application:** The project is a console-based application, meaning it interacts with the user via text input and output in the command line or terminal.
*   **Reservation System:** The application simulates a basic airline reservation system with features like seat selection, passenger details, and ticket generation.
*   **Simple Logic:** The application uses a basic approach to handle reservation and seat availability, with limited error handling.

## Key Features

*   **Seat Selection:** Allows users to specify the number of seats they want to reserve.
*   **Passenger Details:** Prompts the user to enter passenger information such as passport number.
*   **Seat Type Selection:** Allows the user to choose between business or economy class.
*   **Route Selection:** Prompts the user to enter source and destination details.
*   **Ticket Generation:** Prints a ticket in the output if all conditions are met.
*   **Seat Availability:** Displays a "seats filled" message if seats are no longer available based on the entered details.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2.  **Run Project:** Navigate to the project directory and execute the python script using the command:
   
 

## Key Learnings

*   Through this project, I learned to break down a simple real-world problem (airline reservation) into smaller, manageable code tasks. I practiced planning the program flow and implementing basic logic to solve the problem, and learned to deal with some of the limitations as well.

## Usage

*   This application is intended to demonstrate basic python programing and was made as a learning exercise to explore the fundamentals of programming.
